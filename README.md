# Percolation
Estimated the percolation threshold to study the fraction of metallic materials in a conductive composite systems. 
Modeled the Percolation problem using n by n grid with weighted quick union with path compression (WQUPC) algorithm to connect open sites. Used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the percolation threshold.
